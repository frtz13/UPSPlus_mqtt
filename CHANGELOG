v2025.04.02 - frtz13
    - bug fix: with SHUTDOWN_IMMEDIATELY_WHEN_ON_BATTERY parameter activated: do not shut down after 1 hour, if UPS is not on battery

v2023.07.21 - frtz13
	- use USB charging port voltages to determine if UPS is on battery, or not
	- battery health now detecs anomaly when charger is connected and batteries are discharging
	- i2c communication errors are only reported if they happen repeatedly
	- check low battery voltage even when charger is connected. However, this particular check
	  only starts one hour after startup, to give battery voltage a chance to increase after a regular shutdown.

v2023.03.24 - frtz13
	- establish MQTT connection at startup reliably (was broken in v.2023.02.10)
	- added HIGH_BATT_TEMP to sample INI file

v2023.02.10 - frtz13
	- can configure custom ina219 shunt values to calibrate readings
	- current values now in A, power values in W
	- yaml configuration file in new format

v20220110 - frtz13
	- add setSampleInterval.py
	- add optional code to add delay between i2c readings at address 0x17
	- set ceiling value for battery temperature readings (70°C)
	- set ceiling value for battery capacity readings (101%)

v20210906 - frtz13
	- write register addresses in hexadecimal

v20210905 - frtz13
	- reduce i2c register readings at i2c bus address 0x17 to minimum

v20210813 - frtz13
	- fix: now sends fanspeed MQTT message at program startup, even if it is zero
	- added busnum parameter to INA219 sensor initializations
	- HA_config_ups_fan.yaml: added current and power sensor definitions with A and W units, added attributes to UPS_on_battery binary sensor 
	- more renaming in code to get closer to Python naming conventions

v20210624 - frtz13
	- bugfix: shutdown was broken in previous release
	- new command line argument to configure immediate shutdown when on battery: --shutdowntest
	- report MQTT broker connection errors to console and syslog
	- new config file parameter for UpsStatusData feed
	- report repeated failures of sendUpsStatusData to console and syslog
	- if enabled, include response from sendUpsStatusData server in MQTT data

v20210622a - frtz13
	- update feed url in sendUpsStatusData

v20210622 - frtz13
	- some refactoring in code
	- re-read DESIRED_CPU_TEMP_degC every minute

v20210601 - frtz13
	- exception handling in shutdown sequence

v20210526 - frtz13
	- battery power with polarity
	- new command line parameter: --notimerbias
	- uniform averaging period set to twice the battery check loop time
	- battery protection voltage now read every minute.
	- new script: setProtectionVoltage.py
	- new sensors definition file for Home Assistant

v20210521 - frtz13
	- added averaged BatteryPower and OutputPower
	- added exception handling when reading i2c bus
	- lower bound for checking Battery Protection Voltage set to 2500 mV
	- fixed some typos

v20210518 - frtz13
	initial version
